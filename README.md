The Essential Marketing Technology Starter Kit: A Guide for Overwhelmed Marketers
In a world with thousands of marketing technologies, it’s no wonder marketers feel overwhelmed. With so many options, it can be hard to know where to start. A look at businesses shows a surprising truth: outside of the software industry, most are barely scratching the surface of what’s possible. They use a median of just two out of nine key marketing programs.
This is a missed opportunity. Many marketers who have embraced these tools report significant and rapid returns on their investment. But first, they have to convince company leaders to make the initial investment. To help clear that path, I’m proposing a Marketing Technology Starter Kit. This kit outlines seven essential programs that every marketing team should have to grow leads, opportunities, and revenue.
These tools are a modern form of direct marketing, where success has always depended on two things: getting your message in front of the right people and making an offer they find valuable. Just as direct marketers have measured and improved their results for decades, today's marketing technology helps you get the right offer to the right person at the right time.
Here are the seven technologies that are now a basic requirement for any modern marketer.
How do you know what’s working in your marketing?
The Solution: Analytics
For over a century, the famous quote by retail pioneer John Wanamaker has echoed in the marketing world: "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half." Today, that problem is solvable. Smart marketers no longer have to guess what's working. With the right web analytics programs in place, you can track the performance of your marketing channels, campaigns, and ads like never before. The key is not just having the software, but also having people on your team who know how to use the data to make smart decisions.
Conclusion
Building a successful marketing strategy in today's digital world requires a foundational set of tools. The technologies in this Starter Kit are not just a luxury; they are a necessity for tracking your efforts, understanding your audience, and improving your results. By adopting these essential programs, marketers can move past the feeling of being overwhelmed and start proving the value of their work with clear, measurable outcomes. This is the first step toward a more efficient and profitable future for your business# sugam
